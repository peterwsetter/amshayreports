Weekly Texas Hay Report 

***Next report will be released January 4th, 2019.***

   Compared to last report:  All hay classes traded fully steady as we 
close out the year.  Demand was good on limited to moderate supply.  A 
variety of hay continued to be contracted and bought out to meet demands 
of dairies, feed yards and livestock owners.  Coastal Bermuda has become 
difficult to find as well as the freight to get it to the Panhandle tacks 
on costs.  Producers in East, North and South Texas report there may be a 
shortage due to army worms, early frosts and rain hampering their 4th 
cutting.  Prices for hay and pellets quoted per ton except where noted. 

   The Texas Department of Agriculture has Hay and Grazing phone set 
up for Buyers and sellers looking for hay or grazing; the number is 1-
512-787-9966. The website for the hotline is:

   Supreme: Very early maturity, pre bloom, soft fine stemmed, extra 
leafy. Factors indicative of very high nutritive content.  Hay is 
excellent color and free of damage.
   Premium: Early maturity, i.e., pre-bloom in legumes and pre head in 
grass hays, extra leafy and fine stemmed-factors indicative of a high 
nutritive content.  Hay is green and free of damage.  
   Good: Early to average maturity, i.e., early to mid-bloom in legumes 
and early head in grass hays, leafy, fine to medium stemmed, free of 
damage other than slight discoloration. 
   Fair: Late maturity, i.e., mid to late-bloom in legumes, head-in grass 
hays, moderate or below leaf content, and generally coarse stemmed. Hay 
may show light damage. 
   Utility: Hay in very late maturity, such as mature seed pods in
