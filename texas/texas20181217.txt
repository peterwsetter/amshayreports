Weekly Texas Hay Report 

   Compared to last report:  All hay classes traded steady to firm on 
good demand with limited supply.  A variety of hay, such has hay grazer 
or cotton burrs, used to cheapen rations in the Panhandle continues to be 
bought up as soon as it hits the market to soften Alfalfa and Bermuda 
prices.  Coastal Bermuda producers in East, North and South Texas have 
battled army worms, early frosts and rain in getting their 4th cutting 
therefore reports of short supply with many producers already sold out.    
Prices for hay and pellets quoted per ton except where noted. 

   The Texas Department of Agriculture has Hay and Grazing phone set 
up for Buyers and sellers looking for hay or grazing; the number is 1-
512-787-9966. The website for the hotline is:

grass hays, extra leafy and fine stemmed-factors indicative of a high 
nutritive content.  Hay is green and free of damage.

and early head in grass hays, leafy, fine to medium stemmed, free of 
damage other than slight discoloration.
