contract requirements the buyer takes delivery on every cutting in that 
particular year.  All contracts are marketed on a per ton basis. Prices figured 
on a per ton basis or a per point basis (.xx times the RFV).  
   * - When priced on a per point basis.
   * - NEL basis for corn silage

   Corn Silage 30-32 percent dry matter.  Based at .70 to .72 net energy for 
lactation (NEL).  Silage can be quoted standing in the field or delivered to the 
pit. ** All information is a basis for every contract and applies unless 
otherwise stated**
