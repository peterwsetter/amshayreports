Missouri Weekly Hay Summary - Week ending 12/14/2018

A bit milder weather this week as temperatures rose to more comfortable 
levels. Mud is however still an issue in many places and making feeding 
difficult. There continues to be some looming concerns about hay supplies, 
especially given that feeding levels were more than normal most of 
November and these are valid concerns in many local areas.  Overall 
though even with lower supplies nationwide there is still hay that can be 
found but many are not thrilled about prices or distance to get it.  The 
supply of hay light to moderate. Hay prices are steady. Hay demand is 
moderate to good. The Missouri Department of Agriculture has a hay 
directory available for both buyers and sellers. To be listed, or for a 
directory visit http://mda.mo.gov/abd/haydirectory/ for listings of hay 
http://agebb.missouri.edu/haylst/ (All prices f.o.b. and per ton unless 
specified and on most recent reported sales price listed as round bales 
based generally on 5x6 bales with weights of approximately 1200-1500 
lbs).

Hay Quality Designations physical descriptions:

Supreme: Very early maturity, pre bloom, soft fine stemmed, extra 
         leafy.  Factors indicative of very high nutritive content. 
         Hay is excellent color and free of damage.

Premium: Early maturity, i.e., pre-bloom in legumes and pre head in
         grass hays, extra leafy and fine stemmed-factors indicative of
         a high nutritive content.  Hay is green and free of damage.
 
Good:    Early to average maturity, i.e., early to mid-bloom in legumes
         and early head in grass hays, leafy, fine to medium stemmed,
         free of damage other than slight discoloration.
 
Fair:    Late maturity, i.e., mid to late-bloom in legumes, head-in 
         grass hays, moderate or below leaf content, and generally 
         coarse stemmed. Hay may show light damage.

Utility: Hay in very late maturity, such as mature seed pods in legumes
         or mature head in grass hays, coarse stemmed. This category
         could include hay discounted due to excessive damage and heavy
         weed content or mold.
