Missouri Weekly Hay Summary - Week ending 12/21/2018

***this report will not be published the week ending 12/28/18 ***

Much unlike the month of November temperatures over the last two weeks 
continue to be above average with several days getting very close to the 
60 degree mark this past week. Many have said Mother Nature is very 
confused this year but farmers have also found themselves that way as 
there combines are still running in some fields as not all grain has been 
harvested yet. Even more odd is to see hay equipment in the fields and 
there was more than one report of just that this week. This spurred a lot 
of conversation as it is highly unusual. Aside from the novelty of it and 
debate about quality it basically comes down to farmers are trying to 
find a cost feasible way to feed cattle. Although this hay is not the 
answer high quality horse hay is in very short supply and carrying the 
highest demand. The supply of hay light to moderate. Hay prices are 
steady. Hay demand is moderate to good. The Missouri Department of 
Agriculture has a hay directory available for both buyers and sellers. To

Hay Quality Designations physical descriptions:

Supreme: Very early maturity, pre bloom, soft fine stemmed, extra 
         leafy.  Factors indicative of very high nutritive content. 
         Hay is excellent color and free of damage.

Premium: Early maturity, i.e., pre-bloom in legumes and pre head in
         grass hays, extra leafy and fine stemmed-factors indicative of
         a high nutritive content.  Hay is green and free of damage.
 
Good:    Early to average maturity, i.e., early to mid-bloom in legumes
         and early head in grass hays, leafy, fine to medium stemmed,
         free of damage other than slight discoloration.
 
Fair:    Late maturity, i.e., mid to late-bloom in legumes, head-in 
         grass hays, moderate or below leaf content, and generally 
         coarse stemmed. Hay may show light damage.

Utility: Hay in very late maturity, such as mature seed pods in legumes
         or mature head in grass hays, coarse stemmed. This category
         could include hay discounted due to excessive damage and heavy
         weed content or mold.
