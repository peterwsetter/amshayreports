Hay Quality Designations physical descriptions:

Supreme: Very early maturity, pre bloom, soft fine stemmed, extra 
	 leafy.  Factors indicative of very high nutritive content. 
         Hay is excellent color and free of damage.

Premium: Early maturity, i.e., pre-bloom in legumes and pre head in
         grass hays, extra leafy and fine stemmed-factors indicative 
         of a high nutritive content.  Hay is green and free of   
         damage.

Good:    Early to average maturity, i.e., early to mid-bloom in 
         Legumes and early head in grass hays, leafy, fine to medium  
         stems and free of damage other than slight discoloration.
 
Fair:    Late maturity, i.e., mid to late-bloom in legumes, head-in 
         grass hays, moderate or below leaf content, and generally 
         coarse stemmed. Hay may show light damage.

Utility: Hay in very late maturity, such as mature seed pods in 
         Legumes or mature head in grass hays, coarse stemmed. This 
         Category could include hay discounted due to excessive 
         damage and heavy weed content or mold. Defects will be 
         identified in market reports when using this category.
