   RFV calculated using the Wis/Minn formula.  TDN calculated using the     
western formula. Values based on 100% dry matter, TDN both 90% and 100%. 

   Quantitative factors are approximate, and many factors can affect feeding 
Value.  Values based on 100 pct. dry matter.  End usage may influence hay price or 
value more than testing results. 

   ADF = Acid Detergent Fiber; NDF = Neutral Detergent Fiber; RFV = 
Relative Feed Value; TDN = Total Digestible nutrients.
