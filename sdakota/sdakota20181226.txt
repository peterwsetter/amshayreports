South Dakota Weekly Hay Summary 
All prices per ton, unless noted, FOB the stack.

   Compared to last week:  Alfalfa steady on all grades, grass sales are
too few reported to compare.  Very good demand for hay and highest demand
for high feed value hay for calves and especially dairies.  Which is making
 difficult for dairy producers to acquire with already tight margins. Good 
demand for all types of bedding as warmer than average winter weather makes
for muddy yard conditions.  Weather out look for the next week is expected 
to be warmer than average with little to no snow in the forecast.  All hay 
and straw sold by the ton FOB, unless otherwise noted.
