South Dakota Weekly Hay Summary 
All prices per ton, unless noted, FOB the stack.

   Compared to last week:  Alfalfa and grass steady on all grades in a light 
comparison.  Good demand for hay and highest demand for high feed value hay 
for calves and especially dairies.  Which is making difficult for dairy 
producers to acquire with already tight margins.  Rain and snow made 
transportation of hay difficult while ensuring good demand. Weather 
outlook for the next week is expected to colder than the previous month.  
All hay and straw sold by the ton FOB, unless otherwise noted.
