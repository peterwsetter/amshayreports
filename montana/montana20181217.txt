Weekly Montana Hay Report

Compared to last week: Alfalfa hay sold steady to weak. Demand 
continues to be mostly light to moderate on heavy offerings.
The relatively mild winter continues as southern Montana has
temperatures in the 50's while much of the rest of the state 
remains in the 30's and 40's. Snowfall has been limited 
so far this winter and pastures and range remain mostly open.
This continues to curb feeding needs. With heavy supplies
of hay put up across the state this year and light demand 
seen so far producers are beginning to look to sell hay.
Many of the largest sales seen over the last few weeks have 
been to out of state buyers. Dry conditions in Idaho, Oregon,
Wyoming, and Colorado continue to help sell hay across the
state. Additionally, heavy supplies of round bales continues
to be seen as many ranches put up rounds. Large price differences
can be seen between round and squares this year. This is 
particularly true with higher quality grades. All prices are 
dollars per ton and FOB unless otherwise noted. ***This 
will be the last report released this year. Next report will
be Jan. 4th 2018***
